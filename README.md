This project is made using Bootstrap using various kinds of classes, examples - Features (Columns with icons), Full Width Jumbotron, Footer, Responsive left-aligned hero with image, using SVGs and images. Using this project, I got a very good understanding of how bootstrap works, and I was able to apply my understandings in this Project. The idea of this project was given in the Course "Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu.
